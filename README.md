# AT84_motordrive
library with functions for dual motordrive using PWM

I've compiled and used this library successfully with Atmel Studio 6.2

Code assumes that you use an Atmel ATtiny AT84 with an internal clock @ 1 MHz

Suitable to drive two DC motors (eg Pololu geared motors) using a dual H-bridge.

Feel free to use as is.
